# CodewarsChallengers

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), organized by difficulty level and programming language.

## 📁 Repository Structure

CodewarsChallengers/ ├── JavaScrip/ │ ├── 8kyu/ │ ├── 7kyu/ │ ├── 6kyu/ │ └── ... ├── Python/ │ ├── 8kyu/ │ ├── 7kyu/ │ └── ... └── README.md

- Each folder represents a programming language.
- Inside each language folder, challenges are grouped by difficulty level (**kyu**).
- Each file contains the solution to a single challenge, with comments explaining the logic whenever possible.

## 🥋 About the "kyu" Levels

Codewars uses a ranking system inspired by martial arts:

| Level   | Difficulty      |
| ------- | --------------- |
| 8 kyu   | Very easy       |
| 7 kyu   | Easy            |
| 6 kyu   | Intermediate    |
| 5 kyu   | Challenging     |
| 4–1 kyu | Advanced–Expert |

The lower the number, the harder the challenge.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project serves as a personal archive of my coding practice, a way to track my progress, and a resource for others who want to learn or compare solutions.
